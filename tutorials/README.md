# CTSB Tutorials
****************

Below you will find links to Google Colab notebooks that contain tutorials that should help you get going with CTSB. A good place to start for beginners is [**QuickStart**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/johnhallman/ctsb/blob/master/tutorials/notebooks/QuickStart.ipynb), which will guide you through the basics of the framework.


List of Tutorials
=================

Below is a list of notebooks and a brief explanation of what they cover. If you wish to implement custom models or problems you may want to read up on [Google JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) â€” a NumPy-based auto-differentiation package which CTSB depends heavily on.
